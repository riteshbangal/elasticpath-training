# Deployment

The final step in the tutorial is to register the new resources with the cortex webapp, and start it up.

**Note:** To navigate to a particular line in IntelliJ: 
1. From the top navigation menu, choose Navigate, then Line, or 
2. Press Ctrl+G on your keyboard. 

* Modify the ext-cortex webapp `pom.xml`, found at `cortex/ext-cortex-webapp/`. You will need to add a dependency on your `resource-api artifact`, as well as your `resource-prototype` artifact. Add the following code after  `<!-- Add Extension resources or Integration modules as maven dependencies here. -->` _(after line 39)_:

```xml
<dependency>
	<artifactId>terms-and-conditions-api</artifactId>
	<groupId>com.elasticpath.examples.api</groupId>
	<version>project.version</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<artifactId>terms-and-conditions-prototype</artifactId>
	<groupId>com.elasticpath.examples.epcommerce</groupId>
	<version>project.version</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

There is an **INTENTIONAL** mistake in the above dependency declarations. Figure out what the issue is and fix the issue.
------

* Navigate to the `<artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>` section _(found around line 1074)_, 
* You will need to include the `groupId` of your new module. Add the following code below `com.elasticpath.extensions.rest.repositories` within the `<includeGroupIds>` tags _(found around line 1085)_: 

```xml
    com.elasticpath.examples
```

_**Hint:** Notice how each `groupId` except the last groupId in the list has a `,` to seperate it from the previous groupId_

* Within the same `pom.xml`, include the following code at the bottom of the list under the `<excludeArtifactIds>` section _(found around line 1092)_:

```xml
    ep-rest-definitions-schema
```

## Testing the extended resource in Cortex Studio

* Deploy the `Cortex` webapp using `mvn clean tomcat7:run-war` (from `\extensions\cortex\ext-cortex-webapp\`).

* Once the webapp deploys, launch `Elastic Path Cortex Studio` in your web browser and Authenticate as a `PUBLIC` shopper.

* Add the item with sku code `alien_sku` to your cart.

* Navigate to the `Shoppers Default Order` using the Quick Links on the  right hand side panel.

* Enter in the required information for the flashing `NeedInfo`s for the email, billing address, paymentmethodinfo.

* The last `NeedInfo` link should relate to the newly created `termsandconditions`. Click the href link of the `NeedInfo` bneath the `rel: "termsandconditions"`.

* Validate that it has the following structure:
```
{
         rel: "termsandconditions", 
         type: "terms.terms-and-conditions-form", 
         uri: "/terms/mobee/mm3tsmztgbtdiljymjtdmljummygiljzhaztcllemeytamrqmqzwgztbmu=", 
         href: "http://localhost:9080/cortex/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>"
      }, 
      {
         rel: "needinfo", 
         type: "terms.terms-and-conditions-form", 
         uri: "/terms/mobee/mm3tsmztgbtdiljymjtdmljummygiljzhaztcllemeytamrqmqzwgztbmu=", 
         href: "http://localhost:9080/cortex/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>"
      }, 
```

* Follow the href link, it will take you to your `TermsFormResource`. Validate that the `TermsFormResource` has the following structure:

```
{
   self: {
      type: "terms.terms-and-conditions-form", 
      uri: "/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>", 
      href: "http://localhost:9080/cortex/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>"
   }, 
   messages: [ ], 
   accepted: false, 
   message: "Do you accept the Terms and Conditions?", 
   links: [ ]
}
```

* Preform a `PUT` operation on that resource and enter `true` into the accepted field, it should update the `isAccepted` property. Validate that the update is successful, and that the `TermsFormresource` accepted property has been updated by returning to the `GET` operation.

```
{
   self: {
      type: "terms.terms-and-conditions-form", 
      uri: "/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>", 
      href: "http://localhost:9080/cortex/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>"
   }, 
   messages: [ ], 
   accepted: true, 
   message: "Do you accept the Terms and Conditions?", 
   links: [ ]
}
```

* Upon navigating back to the `Orders` resource, you will notice that the `NeedInfo` link to your `TermsFormResource` is no longer present.

* Submit the order.

_**Hint:** If you get the below error when trying to submit and order, try to figure out which web app you forgot to launch_
